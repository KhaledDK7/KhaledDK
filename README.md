# About me
Hello! I'm a passionate aspiring developer currently studying at Macromedia University of Applied Sciences, where I’m focusing on Artificial intelligence. I’m eager to apply the knowledge I’m gaining in university to real-world projects, whether it’s building interactive websites or diving into the world of gaming.

While I’ve worked with Java at a basic level, I’m constantly expanding my skills and exploring new technologies. My ultimate goal is to become a proficient coder and work for a larger company in the future, contributing to impactful projects and continuing to grow professionally.

Outside of coding, I’m a huge fan of gaming and football. When I’m not working on projects, you can find me enjoying a good game or playing football with friends. I'm always excited to connect with like-minded people who share my interests in gaming and coding!

Feel free to explore my repositories and follow along as I develop my skills and work on new projects.
